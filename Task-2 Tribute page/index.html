                    <h2>About Operation Sindoor</h2>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Operation Sindoor</strong> was a landmark military operation by the Indian Armed Forces in May 2025, following the tragic Pahalgam terror attack in which 26 innocent pilgrims lost their lives. The operation was a symbol of India's resolve to combat terrorism and uphold national security.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In a meticulously coordinated action, the Indian Army, Air Force, and intelligence agencies neutralized nine major terror camps across the border. The operation was swift, precise, and sent a clear message: India stands united against terror.

                    <h2>The Meaning Behind "Sindoor"</h2>
                    <p>
                        The name <strong>"Sindoor"</strong> is deeply symbolic. In Hindu tradition, <em>sindoor</em> is the vermilion mark worn by married women, signifying their bond and prayers for their husband's long life. By naming the operation "Sindoor," India paid tribute to the widows of the Pahalgam victims, acknowledging their loss and honoring their strength.
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        "The action taken by the military is good, and by naming it as Operation Sindoor, they have respected the women... The name of the operation is 'Sindoor' and I think it was named this way to respect women like my mother."
                        <br><strong>— Kunal Ganbote, son of a Pahalgam victim</strong>
